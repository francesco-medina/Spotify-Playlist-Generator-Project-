    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create an ipod-like object with various methods that will analyze a comma-separated value file or data frame containing the top 100 songs on spotify in the year 2018. Not only does the data frame contain the artist and name of the songs, but it also introduces various traits like danceability, energy,key, speechiness, liveness, tempo and valence to further give them a unique rating for each trait. The methods created in this project would then aim to create a distinct playlist based on the specific rating constraints being requested. For instance, calling a specific method when looking for songs with a specific tempo or danceability rate would then give you a list of songs that apply to those given limit values. \n",

    "Implementation of Project:\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating this project had various challenges along the way; yet by being patient and googling most of my concerns and errors I was able to eventually accomplish what I actually wanted to do. First I had to learn about the functions and methods displayed in the pandas module in order to analyze a data frame and further work with it. Learning pandas was difficult in the beginning as much of the functions were hard to find, on the other hand, most of the task I wanted to do required if statements while pandas had its own way of processing those if conditions. Once I managed to learn a few built-in functions in pandas, I began to clean out the data frame and get rid of all the columns I did not want to work with. Deleting the columns was pretty easy as I just had to call the “drop” function on that specific column; further getting rid of the column and all its data. After deleting all the columns I did not want to work with, I had to find a way to then make my methods easier to execute. By calling the “round” function from pandas on my columns I was able to round all the values/ratings stored in each column; making it easier for the user to find songs that contained the same rate for danceability and other traits. Once I was done editing the columns, all I had to do was find a way to loop through them and find any songs with that expected value for that given trait.\n",

    "How my code works:\n",
    "    My testing process consist of me picking one specific method and then turning it into a function; pretty much using the same code, just not within a class. However, I do happen to change one little detail. I decided to switch from creating a playlist and appending it to a list, to rather creating a playlist then further updating an empty dictionary with it. By using a dictionary instead of a list, I was able to turn my dictionary to a dataframe much easier while managing to keep my data from looking messy. I did not do this in my original code as my return output playlist would be out of order if I had used a dictionary. \n",
    " \n",
    "Implementing the testing code:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Pandas does not really allow me to flexibly use if, in, assert, along with many other key advantages in python. Yet by creating two distinct playlist, one using my function and the other using simple pandas methods like \"head()\" which simply display the first few rows of a dataframe, I was able to compare them and test out my function. By creating my playlist using dictionaries and then turning them into dataframes, I was able to use the \"isin\" pandas method to check if both my playlist had any row in common. My test would then work as I created those two playlist in unique ways, one using my built-in function and the other one using regular pandas methods; both playlist managed to have a song in common even though my function specifically searched for songs with a certain energy range. This then proves that my function works as the playlist created demonstrated only songs with a lower enegy rating than .5 and managed to match only in one song, the one I used as a test to see if the only similarity in these dataframes actually popped up. When you test the \"isin\" method on both my playlist, only one row evaluates as true.\n",
